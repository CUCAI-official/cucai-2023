                  In its inaugural year of implementation, CUCAI has developed a
                  “Tier Collaboration Program” structured to facilitate
                  involvement from undergraduate AI groups across Canada.
                  Incentives include reserved delegate spots, design showcase
                  involvement, participation in the incubator pitch competition,
                  the undergraduate AI executive showcase and more.
                  Opportunities for partnership with other Canadian
                  undergraduate AI societies have never been so plentiful, as
                  CUCAI’s national reach expands.
