## The Conference
We are a 300+ guest conference attracting top talent from across Canada. This year, we are hosting the conference at Queen's University, on March 4th and 5th. 

CUCAI brings together students looking to do more than their classwork. Our community is one where we actively challenge the status quo around what undergraduate students are capable of achieving in the field of artificial intelligence. We are makers, innovators and disruptors. 

## Our Mission
Designed to connect undergraduate students with industry leaders, the Canadian Undergraduate Conference on Artificial Intelligence provides a platform for companies to develop corporate brand recognition with undergraduate AI talent, facilitate learning about AI, and showcase the diverse opportunities available for students in this field.


## Our History
The first annual Canadian Undergraduate Conference on Artificial Intelligence (CUCAI) took place on March 9th, 2019. Founded by QMIND - Queen’s AI Hub and a strong Queen’s community, the event marked its debut on the national stage with delegations from Queenʼs University, McGill University, University of Toronto, Ryerson University, and University of Manitoba. 

CUCAI 2020 was a huge success, with a breadth of esteemed speakers including Geoffrey Hinton, and sponsors such as TD, RBC, Distributed Compute Labs, KPMG and Accenture. Students attended from McGill, U of T, Waterloo, McMaster, uOttawa, Western and more. Highlights from the conference include the industry showcase, design team showcase, incubator pitch competition, coffee chats with industry and the Women in STEM fireside chat. These events will all be converted to an online format, without impeding the quality of presentation and interaction. 

CUCAI 2021 and CUCAI 2022 rose the challenge of organizing the conference in unprecedented times. We worked diligently keeping up to date with public health guidelines and proved our resilience by creating a fully remote conference in back-to-back years. Over these years, CUCAI included a total of 600+ delegates from 21 schools.
